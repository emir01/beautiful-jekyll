meta-description: An introduction to a basic Analyzer for the Multiple Method call Invocation
---

The [previous](https://blog.emirosmanoski.mk/2020-06-11-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Multiple-Method-Calls/) part of this series served as an introduction to both Roslyn in
general and the problem statement, the code smell we will try to tackle with our
Roslyn Extension.

This second part will follow up on how we start looking at code and performing
our analysis. We will do this by creating a project based on `Analyzer with
Code Fix (.Net Standard)` template and make modification to the Analyzer.

After we setup the analyzer the next and final part of the series will look at how we build and apply simple code changes
to address our problem.

For full context, the following links (will) point to all the articles:

## Analyzer Recap

Roslyn offers a set of API which allow us to hook into the .NET Compiler
pipeline that runs in Visual Studio.

This pipeline includes the Syntax Analysis process which in a sense is constantly running as
it's needed for some of the Key IDE features to work.

For example, Syntax Highlighting in VS needs to know which parts of the text are
variables, which are keywords, methods, expressions and so on so it can apply
different styles to different types of syntax.

So, we have the option to state the following:

- Roslyn, please tell us when you identify a certain type of Token/Syntax occurring in the code we are writing while you are processing the active source file/project/solution.

We can then to do our own custom/specific analysis once we get notified that
what we are interested in has been "detected". So, let's have a look how that works by exploring the default template Analyzer.

## Template Default setup

### Intro and Solution

> The template generates a project that addresses a fictional code smell of
> lowercase names for types. For example, when defining a class `public class
> Animal` the analyzer and fix provider will propose we change the class name to
> `public class ANIMAL`.

We start off by creating a new project based on the `Analyzer with Code Fix (.Net Standard)` template. We name the project `UpperCaseType` and we end up with a solution that looks a little bit like this:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Sample Solution from Base Template](/images/2020-11-02-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Part-2/001__UpperCaseSolution.png)
{:refdef}

What our focus will be for now is the `UpperCaseType` project and specifically the `UpperCaseTypeAnalyzer.cs` file.

{: .box-note} The above solution is generated very close to time of writing
using the latest Preview Version of Visual Studio 2019. If running a different
older versions your results might be different. Notably the template previously
did not have a separate project for the code fix provider. {: .box-note}

Let us now start looking at how we use the types and Roslyn API to register our methods/hooks analysis into the pipeline.

### Analyzer Review

The first thing we do to register an analyzer is going to be inherit from the
base class `DiagnosticAnalyzer` and decorate our implementation with the
`DiagnosticAnalyzer` attribute setting the language to C#:

``` csharp
[DiagnosticAnalyzer(LanguageNames.CSharp)]
public class UpperCaseTypeAnalyzer : DiagnosticAnalyzer
```

This allows us to override the `Initialize` method where we can start using the Roslyn API through the key `AnalysisContext` parameter provided to us in the method:

``` csharp
public override void Initialize(AnalysisContext context)
{
    // TODO: Consider registering other actions
    // that act on syntax instead of or in addition to symbols
    //
    // See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/analyzers/Analyzer%20Actions%20Semantics.md for more information
    context.RegisterSymbolAction(AnalyzeSymbol, SymbolKind.NamedType);
}
```

We use the`AnalysisContext` ro register an `Action` with Roslyn.

The example uses `RegisterSymbolAction` which is described as:

>Register an action to be executed at completion of semantic analysis of an
>ISymbol with an appropriate Kind. A symbol action reports Diagnostics about
>ISymbols.

At this point we can make a difference between two types of analysis or questions we can ask Roslyn about our code:

1. Syntax Analysis & Syntax Related Questions
   1. Deals with the structure of the code by looking at how code statements/expressions are structured and organized to form our program.
   2. Primary deals with Syntax Nodes and Syntax Tokens.
   3. Even though we can analyze multiple files at one given time we can only look at the syntax of a single file.
2. Semantic Analysis & Semantic Related Questions
   1. Deals with the meaning behind the syntax.
   2. Among other things it is primary construct are the Symbols based on the ISymbol interface.
   3. The semantic analysis can span multiple files, for example we can get information for variables with types defined in other files.
   4. We can take a Syntax Node and ask our Semantic Model to provide information about it.

The `RegisterSymbolAction` therefore registers a callback each time Roslyn
detects a specific `semantic` changes. In this case when a new `Symbol` is
detected  more specifically a `NamedType` Symbol specified via the
[SymbolKind](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.symbolkind?view=roslyn-dotnet)
enum.

If we had this simple extension running in an instance
of Visual Studio each time we declare a new Type (Class) the callback method,
`AnalyzeSymbol`  would be called.

### Analyze Symbol

Let's now look at how `AnalyzeSymbol` is structured:

``` csharp
private static void AnalyzeSymbol(SymbolAnalysisContext context)
{
   // TODO: Replace the following code with your own analysis, generating Diagnostic objects for any issues you find
   var namedTypeSymbol = (INamedTypeSymbol)context.Symbol;

   // Find just those named type symbols with names containing lowercase letters.
   if (namedTypeSymbol.Name.ToCharArray().Any(char.IsLower))
   {
         // For all such symbols, produce a diagnostic.
         var diagnostic = Diagnostic.Create(Rule, namedTypeSymbol.Locations[0], namedTypeSymbol.Name);

         context.ReportDiagnostic(diagnostic);
   }
}
```

We see that we can access the Symbol that was detected through `context.Symbol`.
The code casts it to the specific `INamedTypeSymbol` which provides the
following [methods and
properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.inamedtypesymbol?view=roslyn-dotnet)

{: .box-note} The `SymbolAnalysisContext` is the key "interface we have at this
point with the rest of the Roslyn API. It provides the information we are
interested in as well as the key feature of reporting diagnostics, if we find
that the code analyzed contains an issue we want addressed . {: .box-note}

`INamedTypeSymbol` is one of many possible implementations of the general
`ISymbol` interface which provided additional properties and methods depending
on the specific implementation. For more information on the other types of
`ISymbol` refer to this
[link.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.isymbol?view=roslyn-dotnet)

> The (INamedTypeSymbol) cast is safe and does not run the risk of the `context.Symbol` implementing a different interface because when we registered the SymbolAction we specifically said we are interested only in `SymbolKind.NamedType`.

So, let's now have a look at the key part of the code. Checking if this new
Symbol breaks our hypothetical code rule. That is as simple as checking if at
least one character in the `Name` of the Named Type Symbol is lowercase:

``` csharp
if (namedTypeSymbol.Name.ToCharArray().Any(char.IsLower))
```

If that is true, all that is left to do is to use the `SymbolAnalysisContext` to actually report the issue:

### Reporting a Diagnostic

As we see we create a Diagnostic through the [`Diagnostic Class`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.diagnostic?view=roslyn-dotnet)

``` csharp
// For all such symbols, produce a diagnostic.
var diagnostic = Diagnostic.Create(Rule, namedTypeSymbol.Locations[0], namedTypeSymbol.Name);
context.ReportDiagnostic(diagnostic);
```

There are a couple of things we can go over regarding the reporting.

#### The Rule

The `Rule` object is a static property of type `DiagnosticDescriptor`. It is an object that describes what the Analyzer does and comes pre-built for us through the template.

It's our interface with some of the UI elements in the Visual Studio IDE when our extension and analyzer is running and reporting diagnostics.

We also use it do define the Category of the diagnostic and the severity. More information about the class can be found [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.diagnosticdescriptor?view=roslyn-dotnet)

``` csharp
public const string DiagnosticId = "UpperCaseType";

// You can change these strings in the Resources.resx file. If you do not want your analyzer to be localize-able, you can use regular strings for Title and MessageFormat.
// See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/analyzers/Localizing%20Analyzers.md for more on localization
private static readonly LocalizableString Title =
new LocalizableResourceString(nameof(Resources.AnalyzerTitle), Resources.ResourceManager, typeof(Resources));

private static readonly LocalizableString MessageFormat =
new LocalizableResourceString(nameof(Resources.AnalyzerMessageFormat), Resources.ResourceManager, typeof(Resources));

private static readonly LocalizableString Description =
new LocalizableResourceString(nameof(Resources.AnalyzerDescription), Resources.ResourceManager, typeof(Resources));

private const string Category = "Naming";

private static DiagnosticDescriptor Rule =
 new DiagnosticDescriptor(DiagnosticId, Title, MessageFormat, Category,
                          DiagnosticSeverity.Warning, isEnabledByDefault: true, description: Description);
```

#### The Location

The location of the issue associated with the diagnostic. This is where we can use the actual namedTypeSymbol analyzed and get the location from its Locations list.

> The location is a list because of things like Partial Classes. In that case the named symbol is going to be declared in multiple locations.

#### The Message Arguments

The third parameter when creating the rule is a list of message arguments. This
is where we circle back to the DiagnosticDescriptor and the `MessageFormat`
parameter. The arguments we provide will be used in the MessageFormat which for
the starting template is `Type name '{0}' contains lowercase letters`

And that is basically it! :heavy_check_mark:

This template project can be published generating an extension installation
file. We can also Debug (F5) the .VSIX which will run a "Test" instance of Visual Studio with the extension installed and we can see how the sample analyzer reports the diagnostic:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Reported Diagnostic](/images/2020-11-02-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Part-2/01_ReportedDiagnostic.png)
{:refdef}

---

That covers the review of the Analyzer that comes out of the box with the
template. Hopefully it served as a good introduction and anchor point for
parallels for the Sample Problem Analyzer we will look at next.

## Sample Problem Analyzer (Multiple Method Calls)

Through the basic analyzer in the template we’ve covered a very general/basic
example of how Analyzers work.

The analyzer for the problem statement from the [previous
part](https://blog.emirosmanoski.mk/2020-06-11-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Multiple-Method-Calls/#the-sample-problem)
of the series will follow this general approach using the same API to register
against Roslyn/Compiler actions.

It is just going to be interested in slightly different code "written" events
and will slightly expand the actual custom analysis (the lowercase check) to something more interesting!

> Reminder of problem statement: We want to be notified if we are unnecessarily
> calling the same function multiple times within the current scope
> (method/function) instead of re-using the return results.

{: .box-warning}
**A word of caution:** The analyzer presented here is not
complete! It is a proof of concept for learning purposes and as we will see even
ignores certain scenarios and makes simplification & assumptions to illustrate different aspects of the analysis.
{: .box-warning}

### Initialize and Register our Callback

We want to start with Roslyn letting us know when method scope has been defined.

We do not care about any function calls in other methods in the same class as We
cannot re-use the results from a call across method scopes.

{: .box-note}
This is where we start making assumptions and simplifications. There is potentially a better & more complicated way
to do this which would cover more advanced scenarios. We focus only on calls within a single method scope for now, but we could potentially expand this to store results
in a class property if for example the class has two methods making the identical call. Additionally, we ignore block scope method calls, for example within `if` statements, but again nothing is stopping us from expanding the analysis to check for this as well.
{: .box-note}

To achieve our goal of analyzing code within Method Blocks we are going to use
the [`RegisterCodeBlockStartAction`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.diagnostics.analysiscontext.registercodeblockstartaction?view=roslyn-dotnet) registration.

Ths is where we deviate slightly from the Template example. If we look at the documentation for `RegisterCodeBlockStartAction` we see that the callback we need to register cannot report
Diagnostics. It should further register additional callbacks that would do that based on certain conditions:

``` csharp
context.RegisterCodeBlockStartAction<SyntaxKind>(analysisContext =>
{
      if (analysisContext.OwningSymbol.Kind != SymbolKind.Method)
      {
         return;
      }

      // create a new analyzer for this code block
      var analyzer = new StatefulNodeAnalyzer();

      analysisContext.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(
         ctx => analyzer.AnalyzeSyntaxNode(ctx, analysisContext.CodeBlock),
         SyntaxKind.InvocationExpression);
});
```

What we are doing here is saying that any time a `Code Block`
(CodeBlockStartAction) which is a `Method` (the OwningSymbol.Kind check) is
analyzed we register a `SyntaxNodeAction` that will only look at SyntaxNodes of
type `SyntaxKind.InvocationExpression`!

> [InvocationExpressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.csharp.syntax.invocationexpressionsyntax?view=roslyn-dotnet) syntax is exactly what we are interested in as it is
> how function calls are represented.

Here we have the next slight difference from the template example. We create our own
custom `StatefulNodeAnalyzer` and manually invoke the `AnalyzeSyntaxNode` method
by also passing the `CodeBlock` provided from the `RegisterCodeBlockStartAction`
`AnalysisContext`.  

We do this because we want to restrict where we search/analyze multiple method
invocations.

We are now in a position where:

1. We've stated that we want to know when C# Method Code Blocks
2. When dealing with such Method Blocks, we register a SyntaxNodeAction only for [InvocationExpressionSyntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.csharp.syntax.invocationexpressionsyntax?view=roslyn-dotnet)
3. When such [InvocationExpressionSyntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.csharp.syntax.invocationexpressionsyntax?view=roslyn-dotnet) is found (a method/function call is encountered) we run the custom `AnalyzeSyntaxCode` method.
4. We pass the Method Code Block through to `AnalyzeSyntaxCode` as it will help
   us narrow down the search of a multiple calls.

{: .box-note}
One of the more useful resources when exploring the approaches for
defining the Analyzer described here were the [Roslyn SDK Samples
Repository](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-sdk/tree/master/samples/CSharp/Analyzers/Analyzers.Implementation/StatefulAnalyzers)
where the initial idea for the `StatefulNodeAnalyzer` was found. **Note** that
our Analyzer currently does not depend on a state that has to be kept in the
`StatefulNodeAnalyzer` class, but we kept the separate class method to
keep track of the method code block.
{: .box-note}

### Analyzing & finding multiple method calls

Now let us look at the `AnalyzeSyntaxNode` method by breaking down and exploring bigger sections of the code that deal with their own concerns with the analysis.

We will also see that we will not be just looking at only pure Syntax, but also analyzing the Semantics and meaning of some of the code.

{: .box-note}
**Note:** One important practice is to stop analyzing as soon as
possible to improve performance. That is reflected in the code bellow which runs
small quick checks trying to determine as soon as possible that there is no
problem with the code.
{: .box-note}

#### Gathering Initial Information and Checks

The definition and starting lines of code for the `AnalyzeSyntaxNode` method:

``` csharp
public void AnalyzeSyntaxNode(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext context,
         SyntaxNode methodCodeBlock)
{
         // we are going to run the analysis in the context of the code block
         // which for us would be the method.
         //
         // We want to search for any invocations within that method code block - for now!

         var semanticModel = context.SemanticModel;

         var node = (InvocationExpressionSyntax)context.Node;

         var methodSymbol = (IMethodSymbol)semanticModel.GetSymbolInfo(node).Symbol;

         if (methodSymbol != null && methodSymbol.ReturnsVoid)
         {
            return;
         }

         // ....
         // .... More code to follow!

}
```

We start the analysis by getting the [Semantic
Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/get-started/semantic-analysis)
and the `InvocationExpressionSyntax` Node (which is very similar as in the basic
example).

The next line:

``` csharp
var methodSymbol = (IMethodSymbol)semanticModel.GetSymbolInfo(node).Symbol;
```

Queries the `Semantic` model for information about our InvocationExpression
`Syntax` _node_.

What we expect to get is a [IMethodSymbol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.imethodsymbol?view=roslyn-dotnet) implementation.

This object, if available, will give us meaningful information about the method
we are looking at.

So, how does this work exactly. There are several things/steps to note:

1. Within our code block we encountered Syntax which as we can tell is an invocation of a Method/Function!
2. Syntax cannot tell us anything about the Method and we even do not know if the file we are analyzing contains the syntax for declaring the method. The method can be declared in a different file.
3. That is why we use the `SemanticModel` which "operates" beyond just this single file/method.
4. If the method has been declared properly the Semantic Model would have encountered it and would have built its knowledge around it.
5. When it gets asked to `GetSymbolInfo` for our `InvocationExpressionSyntax` node the semantic model can reason about the expression and tie it to a Symbol (method definition) it knows about.

From here the first thing we check is if the Method returns `void` (using
`ReturnsVoid`) or in other words does not return anything. This is important for
solving our problem statement by re-using the returned value of the first encountered call call.

We stop further analysis if there is no return type as we cannot actually provide
a solution to the code-smell! This circles back to the optimization argument of
stopping as soon as possible. No diagnostic can be reported if the invoked
function does not return anything no matter how many times it is called.

{: .box-note}
**Note** The
[`IMethodSymbol`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.imethodsymbol?view=roslyn-dotnet)
refers to the "definition" of the method. The value of the `ReturnsVoid`
property is not going to change regardless of where or how many times we call
the method. Some additional interesting properties present on the interface are `IsExtensionMethod`, `IsOverride` and many others!
{: .box-note}

#### Counting how many times we invoke the function

The next block of code in the analyzer checks if we have a problem to solve
based on the key problem statement of multiple calls.

At this point we know that the method/function returns a value, but if the
function is only called once, there is nothing further to analyze and
solve.

We do several checks, again in order to optimize the types and counts of
different checks and traversals through the syntax.

Each previous check creates a list of method invocation within the block that
feed the next check which then further refines the conditions that must be met
for us to conclude a problem occurring:

``` csharp
// ----
// ---- Previous Code

// Traverse the code block
var allInvocationExpressions =
   methodCodeBlock.DescendantNodes().OfType<InvocationExpressionSyntax>().ToList();

// If there are no other invocations except the current one tracked by the 'node'
// don't do any other processing.
if (allInvocationExpressions.Count == 1)
{
   return;
}

// We want to get only the nodes that refer to the same function I'm checking for in the current
// method block.

// If for example we had a call to OurMethod(input) and Console.WriteLine()

var currentNodeExpression = node.Expression.ToString();

var invocationsOnlyWithCurrentNodeExpression =
   allInvocationExpressions.Where(expressionNode =>
      expressionNode.Expression.ToString().Equals(currentNodeExpression)).ToList();

// if we end up with  1 then there are no other invocations matching current node.
if (invocationsOnlyWithCurrentNodeExpression.Count == 1)
{
   return;
}

// Now we get the invocations that are not the Current one by looking at
// the location where they start in the code block
var otherInvocationsMatchingCurrent =
   invocationsOnlyWithCurrentNodeExpression.Where(inv => inv.Span.Start != node.Span.Start).ToList();

// ----
// ---- More Code

```

First, we check if there is at least one more InvocationExpression Syntax Node
for _any_ method within the same method code block. If our current method is the
only call we stop further analysis.

We do this by checking the count on the `DescendantNodes()` of the
`methodCodeBlock` (we made sure we passed that when registering our action) of type `InvocationExpressionSyntax`.

{: .box-note}
The code and comments make references to current node or current method. That
refers to the fact that the analyzer code has been invoked specifically
after the engineer has typed/completed code that expresses a method call. He
might have written such code before and he will probably write such code after
and each time this analysis will run, and we can look at the previous/other
methods he has written within the method code block
{: .box-note}

If we have multiple method/function calls within the code block we check if the
InvocationExpressions we found (at least one or multiple) match or invoke the
same method that is being invoked with the current invocation syntax.

We do this by looking at the expression property and filter the
`allInvocationExpressions` from the previous check to only those with the same matching
`Expression` property. To illustrate, let us look at the `Expression` value of the
`Foo` method calls as seen in the`Syntax Visualizer`:

``` csharp
class Program
{
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      var input = 4;
      int x, y;

      x = Foo(input);
      y = Foo(input);

      Console.WriteLine(x);
      Console.WriteLine(y);
   }

   static int Foo(int i)
   {
      return 4;
   }
}
```

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Foo Invocation Expression property in Tree](/images/2020-11-02-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Part-2/02_InvocationExpression_ExpressionProperty.png)
{:refdef}

Based on that, from here we need a simple filter on that property to give us all
the invocations within our code block that are calling the same method.

If it is still just one such method (the current one) we stop analyzing.

If there are multiple such calls (>1) at this point it means that:

> A method that returns a value has been called multiple times within this code block.

Unfortunately, this is still not enough for us to determine that there is a
problem with our code. It could very well mean that each call is using different
parameters/arguments & values. It is reasonable to assume that if a method has
been called multiple times with different parameters the multiple invocation has
been intentional and we expect different results.

We will take the analysis a step further and check if all the other invocations
we found (besides the current one) have the same argument list.

For that we create the `otherInvocationsMatchingCurrent` list which is created
by filtering on the `Span.Start` property to only get the invocations that are
not the current node based on the occurrence (start) in the code block.

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** Even with the argument check this is by no means a
 complete solution to the analysis. I don't even think that for such a problem a
 complete full-proof, "Yes these X method calls always return the same result"
 is even possible. For starters we can consider the opposite of [Pure
 Functions](https://www.sitepoint.com/functional-programming-pure-functions/#:~:text=A%20pure%20function%20is%20a,always%20return%20the%20same%20result.)
 and the challenge they present for the approach. So, we can present the analysis
 findings and fixes as a "For your consideration" proposal and allow the
 engineers to make the right calls of applying the fix or ignoring the
 diagnostic.
 {: .box-warning}

#### Checking Arguments and Reporting Diagnostics

We are now quite close to making our final decisions. Let us have a look at the final part of the code that builds on the `otherInvocationsMatchingCurrent`:

``` csharp
 // simple argument matching
var currentArgumentsList = node.ArgumentList.Arguments;

var invocationsWithMatchingArgumentList = otherInvocationsMatchingCurrent.Where(inv =>
   ArgumentListsMatch(currentArgumentsList, inv.ArgumentList.Arguments)).ToList();

if (invocationsWithMatchingArgumentList.Count > 0)
{
   var methodName = node.Expression.ToString();
   var argumentList = node.ArgumentList.Arguments.ToString();

   var diagnostic = Diagnostic.Create(Rule, node.GetLocation(), methodName, argumentList);

   context.ReportDiagnostic(diagnostic);
}
```

Here we use the `ArgumentList.Arguments` property on the
[InvocationExpressionSyntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.csharp.syntax.invocationexpressionsyntax?view=roslyn-dotnet)
nodes for the current node/call and all the other matching Invocation
Expressions (`otherInvocationsMatchingCurrent`).

We are looking for at least one of the other Invocations to have a matching
argument list, a check done in the `ArgumentListsMatch` helper method.

Let us take a look at that method next, before circling back to reporting the
diagnostic.

``` csharp
private bool ArgumentListsMatch(SeparatedSyntaxList<ArgumentSyntax> originalArgumentList,
      SeparatedSyntaxList<ArgumentSyntax> toMatchArgumentList)
{
      if (originalArgumentList.Count != toMatchArgumentList.Count)
      {
         return false;
      }

      for (int i = 0; i < originalArgumentList.Count; i++)
      {
         var originalCandidate = originalArgumentList[i];
         var toMatchCandidate = toMatchArgumentList[i];

         if (originalCandidate.Expression.ToString() != toMatchCandidate.Expression.ToString())
         {
            return false;
         }
      }

      return true;
}
```

The method operates over two
[SeparatedSyntaxList<ArgumentSyntax>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.csharp.syntax.argumentlistsyntax.arguments?view=roslyn-dotnet#Microsoft_CodeAnalysis_CSharp_Syntax_ArgumentListSyntax_Arguments)
objects that represent our arguments. One is always going to be the argument list of our current node - while the other will be for an invocation in the `otherInvocationsMatchingCurrent` collection.

The check is very simple and is based on the number of arguments and the
`ArgumentSyntax` `Expression` property. Once again we can look at the `SyntaxAnalyzer` and use the `Foo()` method from the previous example to see how the
properties of an `Argument` in the `Argument List` are described:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Expressions in Tree](/images/2020-11-02-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Part-2/03_InvocationExpression_Arguments.png)
{:refdef}

For the purposes of the article we will leave the check to only look at the
expression. There is more that can be done here and expand/improve
the check, by potentially also looking at the Semantic Model.

{: .box-warning} **Warning:** The argument check is also not complete and would
not cover all scenarios to fully identify if the argument lists match. The check
also ignores the "value" aspect. The check would work when we are dealing with
literals like: `Foo(2)` or `Bar("Input Parameter")` but it would fail if we deal
with the same "value" passed by a different name. This is an area
that could use some improvement in the future in terms of using data flow
analysis (semantics) and potentially presenting flagged cases to the engineer
as something to be resolved within their discretion. {: .box-warning}

##### Reporting Diagnostic

If the simple argument check finds that the methods are invoked with the same
arguments we can proceed to report an issue.

The Diagnostic report has nothing out of the ordinary when compared to the
sample/template reporting. We still need to define a `Diagnostic Descriptor` which in our case can be defined as:

``` csharp
public const string DiagnosticId = "MultipleMethodCallDiagnosticAnalyzer";

private static readonly string Title = "Multiple Method Invocation";

public static readonly string MessageFormat =
   @"{0} called multiple times with identical arguments: [{1}]";

private static readonly string Description = "Multiple Identical Method Invocation";

private const string Category = "Usage";

private static readonly DiagnosticDescriptor Rule = new DiagnosticDescriptor(DiagnosticId, Title, MessageFormat, Category, DiagnosticSeverity.Warning, true, Description);
```

We then use the rule within the arguments match if block:

``` csharp
var methodName = node.Expression.ToString();
var argumentList = node.ArgumentList.Arguments.ToString();

var diagnostic = Diagnostic.Create(Rule, node.GetLocation(), methodName, argumentList);

context.ReportDiagnostic(diagnostic);
```

The slight difference here is the amount of Message Arguments and how we get the
Diagnostic Location, through using the
[`GetLocation()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.csharp.csharpsyntaxnode.getlocation?view=roslyn-dotnet#Microsoft_CodeAnalysis_CSharp_CSharpSyntaxNode_GetLocation)
method on the
[`InvocationExpressionSyntax`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.csharp.syntax.invocationexpressionsyntax?view=roslyn-dotnet)
class object.

{: .box-note}
**Note:** Remember that the analysis is constantly running so in
the simple case of the double `Foo()` method invocation we will actually report
two diagnostics in two different locations where we call the method. After we
finish writing/coding the second call - our code detects a duplicate in the
first method call. The analysis also would run on the first method as well,
which now will consider the second call as the duplicate! :recycle:
{: .box-note}

## In Action

So let's see this in action, using our sample `Foo()` method program. For this
we can either Debug or Build the `.Vsix` project. If we build it the output
folder will contain a .vsix extension we can install to Visual studio and it
would run in the background as we write code!

Getting back to our sample code after we've setup the extension in either way,
we can see that both the methods have a `warning` squiggly line underlying the
invocations:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Squiggly Lines under multiple Foo Method Invocation showing there have been reported diagnostics](/images/2020-11-02-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Part-2/04_Foo_Diagnostic.png)
{: refdef}

And if we hover over either of the two `warnings` we get, as expected, we get the full
IDE experience reporting our diagnostic:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Full details of reported multiple invocation warnings matching message format](/images/2020-11-02-Roslyn-Syntax-Analyzer-Part-2/05_Foo_DiagnosticDetails.png)
{: refdef}

## Summary

We now have a simple Analyzer that reports diagnostics when we
find methods that return values being invoked multiple times with the same
arguments within a method code block.

Our analyzer generates diagnostic objects which point to a specific location in
our code. These diagnostics have the `DiagnosticId` value of
`MultipleMethodCallDiagnosticAnalyzer`. By using `ReportDiagnostic` we've
registered these with the Roslyn Pipeline.

In the next part of the series we take our "Extension" a step further by seeing
how we can now register code that would "listen" and action our reported
diagnostics by continuing to user the Roslyn API to specifically address
`MultipleMethodCallDiagnosticAnalyzer` diagnostics.
