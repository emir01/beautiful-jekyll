# Unity 3D Introduction

Recently I started re-learning and using Unity 3D for a while after signing up
for some live courses they were offering on their site and after signing up for
the premium learn option that was free for 3 months

While following the course I got an idea about a game with survival mechanics
about a mysterious forest where you had to scavange  for resources to survive.

That little backstory was one of the background aspects to thinking about and
designing some of the game systems.

What I like about Unity here is that it sort of puts you in a position where the
systems you design have to be also thought out from a game design and tooling
perspective if someone else would be using the Engine and the systems you've
developed to tell a story.

So for example the Encounter System we will go through in this post can be used
via the Unity Inspector to design different types of encounters without really
any programming.
